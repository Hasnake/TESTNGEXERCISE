What is WebDriver?
------------------
------------------

WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your tests against different browsers,
not just Firefox (unlike Selenium IDE).

•Google Chrome
•Mozilla Firefox
•Internate Explorer
•Safari
•Opera Browser
•GhostDriver





WebDriver also enables you to use a programming language in creating your test scripts (not possible in Selenium IDE).

 You can now use conditional operations like if-then-else or switch-case
 You can also perform looping like do-while.

Following programming languages are supported by WebDriver

Java
.Net
PHP
Python
Perl
Ruby
You do not have to know all of them. You just need to be knowledgeable in one.
However, in this tutorial, we will be using Java with Eclipse as our IDE.


Selenium WebDriver: Access Form, CheckBox, RadioButton & TextBox

Forms are the fundamental web elements to receive information from the website visitors.
Web forms have different GUI elements like Text boxes, Password fields, Checkboxes, Radio buttons, dropdowns, file inputs, etc.
Web Driver provides the following two methods to find the elements.

findElement() – finds a single web element and returns as a WebElement object.
findElements() – returns a list of WebElement objects matching the locator criteria.
